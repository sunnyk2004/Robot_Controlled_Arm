# Phone Controlled Robot Arm
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone for this project was being able to understand the parts needed for my phone controlled robot arm and get a servo up and running. First I learned about the different parts that are essential for this robotic arm project. The main component being the Arduino Board, I learned its various functions and how to connect it to my laptop to be able to program on it. I then learned how to make an LED light up using the Arduino and a breadboard. Then I moved onto something more complicated and connected a servo to the Arduino board. This let me change the movement of the servo with any input that I desired. Some issues that I ran into were that my servo at first didn't rotate and I fixed this by modifying the code and placing the jumper wires in the proper pin holes. In this first modification I also started to get my bluetooth connection working. My next steps are to be able to get a fully functional bluetooth connection and assemble the robot arm itself.
